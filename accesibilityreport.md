## Universal Design Principles

This application was designed with universal design principles in mind, focusing particularly on making movie discovery accessible to all users.

## Target Market

Our program would be marketed towards movie enthusiasts who want a personalized way to discover new movies. This includes casual viewers who want to keep track of movies they'd like to watch and dedicated film buffs who want good AI-based reasonings for why they are receiving specific movie recommendations. The program is particularly appealing to users who value organization in their media consumption and appreciate getting contextual recommendations rather than just algorithmic suggestions. The cross-device compatibility makes it ideal for users who want to manage their watchlist across different platforms.

### Implementation of Universal Design Principles

- Multiple ways to find movies (title search, genre filtering, ratings)
- Flexible watchlist management system
- Personalized recommendation system adapting to user preferences

#### Principle 3: Simple and Intuitive Use
- Clear, straightforward navigation
- Consistent layout across all screens
- Intuitive movie selection and watchlist management
- Easy-to-understand recommendation system

#### Principle 4: Perceptible Information
- Clear visual feedback for user actions
- Explicit confirmation messages for important actions

#### Principle 5: Tolerance for Error
- Confirmation required for deletions
- Clear error messages
- Easy navigation back to previous screens
- Simple process to correct mistakes in searches or selections

#### Principle 6: Low Physical Effort
- Minimal clicks required for common actions
- Efficient search and filter functionality
- Simple process for adding/removing movies from watchlist

#### Principle 7: Size and Space for Approach and Use
- Large, clickable buttons and interface elements
- Spacious layout preventing accidental selections
- Clear visual hierarchy in the interface

## Demographics and Accessibility Analysis

Our program currently presents several barriers that may make it less accessible to certain demographics, reflecting both medical and social model considerations of disability. For users with visual impairments, our interface relies heavily on visual elements without providing alternative access methods like screen readers or audio descriptions - this represents a social model barrier where our design choices create limitations. For users with motor impairments who may have difficulty with precise mouse movements, the lack of keyboard navigation options and adjustable interface sizing creates unnecessary barriers to access. The English-only interface creates a social barrier for non-English speakers, while the requirement for consistent internet access and modern devices may exclude users from lower socioeconomic backgrounds or areas with limited connectivity. From a cognitive accessibility perspective, while we've aimed for an intuitive interface, users with attention deficit disorders or learning disabilities might find the multi-step processes challenging without clear step-by-step guidance or simplified interface options. These limitations aren't inherent to the users' conditions (medical model) but rather arise from our design choices (social model) - highlighting areas where we could improve accessibility through features like screen reader compatibility, keyboard navigation, multiple language support, offline mode, and cognitive accessibility features. This would help shift our application from creating social barriers to being more universally accessible.

### Areas for Future Improvement
1. **Accessibility Enhancements**:
   - Implement larger text options
   - Add text-to-speech functionality for movie searches
   - Include audio descriptions for visually-impaired users
   - Support screen reader compatibility

2. **Interface Adaptability**:
   - Add support for keyboard-only navigation
   - Implement customizable color schemes
   - Allow interface scaling for different visual needs
